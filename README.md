# Open Source AIS Transponder (Class B)

This is the first ever (that I'm aware of) attempt at creating an open source AIS transponder. The prototype device
based on this code and designs is fully functional, but there is still a long way to go before it is a "compliant" unit.

I intend to publish a blog (linking to and from here) as the project evolves.
